	<h2>Providing pre-rendered markup</h2>
	<p>You can improve the load time of your page by providing the markup that the <placeholder name="name"/> widget would normally create during its initialization.</p>
	<p>By providing this markup yourself, and by indicating that you have done so by setting the attribute <code>data-enhanced="true"</code>, you instruct the <placeholder name="name"/> widget to skip these DOM manipulations during instantiation and to assume that the required DOM structure is already present.</p>
	<p>When you provide such pre-rendered markup you must also set all the classes that the framework would normally set, and you must also set all data attributes whose values differ from the default to indicate that the pre-rendered markup reflects the non-default value of the corresponding widget option.</p>
