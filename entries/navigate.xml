	<desc>A wrapper event for both hashchange and popstate</desc>
	<longdesc>
		<p>The navigate event is a wrapper around both the <code>hashchange</code> and <code>popstate</code> events. In addition to providing a single event for all browsers it also provides a data object in both cases allowing for the unification of handlers. This feature is used by the <code>$.mobile.navigate</code> method to include directionality and url information.</p>
	</longdesc>
	<example>
		<desc>Change the hash fragment twice then log the data provided with the navigate event when the browser moves backward through history. NOTE: The state will no be tracked or provided by default in browsers that only support hashchange. For that functionality please see the navigate method docs.</desc>
		<code><![CDATA[
// Bind to the navigate event
$( window ).on( "navigate", function( event, data ){
	console.log( data.state );

// Trigger a navigate event by pushing state
window.history.pushState( { foo: "bar" }, "Title", "http://example.com/#foo" );

// From the `navigate` binding on the window, console output:

// Trigger a navigate event by pushing state
window.history.pushState( {}, "Title", "http://example.com/#bar" );

// From the `navigate` binding on the window, console output:

// Trigger a navigate event by moving backward through history
window.history.back();

// From the `navigate` binding on the window, console output:
