	<desc>This event is triggered after the <code>changePage()</code> request has finished loading the page into the DOM and all page transition animations have completed. </desc>
	<longdesc>
		<p>Note that any pageshow or pagehide events will have fired *BEFORE* this event is triggered. Callbacks for this particular event will be passed a data object as the 2nd arg. The properties for this object are as follows: </p>
			<ul>
				<li><code>toPage</code> (object or string)
					<ul>
						<li>This property represents the page the caller wishes to make active. It can be either a jQuery collection object containing the page DOM element, or an absolute/relative url to an internal or external page. The value exactly matches the 1st arg to the changePage() call that triggered the event.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li><code>options</code> (object)
					<ul>
						<li>This object contains the configuration options to be used for the current <code>changePage()</code> call.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
